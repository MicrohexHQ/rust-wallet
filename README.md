# Bitcoin Wallet Library in Rust
This is a library to build Bitcoin wallets with Rust. 
It uses BIP32 key derivation, BIP39 mnemonics and BIP44 key 
hierarchy which makes it compatible to TREZOR, Ledger and many other
wallets.

## Goal
Offer a standalone wallet in conjunction with rust-bitcoin-spv.
I plan to add TREZOR and Ledger support.

## Status
BIP32 and BIP39 support ready

## Contributions and Vision
The goal is a library for key derivation, storage, serialization and account management.

Send in your PRs if aligned with above vision.
